Yandex has stated that Yandex Browser has learned how to translate videos from Chinese. The browser can translate videos from Chinese and automatically overlay Russian voiceover, the IT company's press service told the Habr information service.

According to the developers, the technology is already working on YouTube, and later there will be support for the Chinese video platform Bilibili. There were no ready-made solutions for the Chinese language, so the developers built a dataset from scratch. Using a special algorithm, the creators processed 1.5 million videos and selected 100,000 with high-quality subtitles in Northern Chinese.

Turning speech into text was the first stage of translation, and for this, the neural network used in Yandex Browser had to learn thousands of hieroglyphs. The neural network has learned to understand hieroglyphs, and the developers have encoded a dictionary for working with the Chinese language in the form of 10,000 tokens. One token is a single syllable or a regularly used combination of two syllables. As the creators say, five European languages, translated by Yandex Browser, fit into a library of 5,000 tokens. In addition, the neural network was trained to divide a continuous stream of hieroglyphs into semantic segments to accurately synchronize the translation with the original speech.

The most difficult feature of the Chinese language is learning the four tones that determine the meaning of what is said. A tone is a melodic pattern of a voice. The same syllable, pronounced with a raised or lowered voice, means different things. It takes years for a person to understand this feature. The developers claim that the neural network of Yandex Browser has coped in a month. There are also many homophones in Chinese â€” words that sound the same, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. To distinguish between them, the Browser's neural networks are able to take into account the context. A detailed description of the technology features is published in the developers' article.
